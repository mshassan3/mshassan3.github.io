        Hi everyone, 
        My name is Mehnaz Hassan and I go by May at work. I have been teaching for the last five school years. I like this class so far because we are learning content that we can apply (do hands-on). If it is online, I learn the best in a quiet place where I can hear myself thinking.
        My expectations for this course are to learn how web applications and a website works, how to use HTML and CSS to develop web pages, and how to deploy a website and do it smoothly. In general, how to use coding to develop websites professionally and learn more about how they work and to develop them smoothly so it requires least amount of maintenance. I hope to create webpages with a team or individually for small companies or large corporations.
        I have so many hobbies and it is hard to choose just one. I would choose going to the beach and hanging out with family and friends through board games or just chilling. I also enjoy being inspired by youtube, pinterest, and other social media to learn and create new projects.
