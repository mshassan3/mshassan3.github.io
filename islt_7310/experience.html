    <p class = "experience">I was a substitute teacher from January 2014 to June 2014 in Chico Unified School District.During this position, I maintained order in the classroom by efficiently executing lesson plans left by the teacher, and I applied the necessary teaching strategies to use in classrooms with various skill levels. I learned how important classroom management is in any class throughout substituting. 
    </p>
    <p class="experience">I taught sixth grade math my first school year at Bryant Middle School for Dos Palos Oro Loma Joint Unified School District in September of 2015. I generated reports for attendance, assessed students, and reported and analyzed studentsâ€™ results. The CPM (College Preparatory Math) curriculum, using whiteboards for interactive activities with students, online programs, and mathematical software created an interactive learning environment. I cooperated with fellow teachers and parents to ensure students have the best learning tools and environment for student growth. I managed and organized groups of up to thirty students and provided them with behavioral guidelines. I facilitated class discussion and maintained a positive learning environment. I had a great mentor who taught me the importance of student centered learning where students are learning from each other using common core instead of traditional teaching.  </p>

    <p class="experience">
    During August 2016 until June 2020, I taught seventh grade math (including an intervention and accelerated course) for Merced City School District. I adopted and implemented new curriculum that combined elements of geometry, algebra, probability, and statistics. I kept student records and analyzed them biweekly in order to address problematic areas and ensure student progress. I implemented various teaching techniques and differentiated instruction. I organized meetings with parents and fellow educators to discuss current classroom issues and student success. I maintained rapport with students and fostered open communication in culturally-diverse classrooms. Additionally, I held after-school tutoring for all students. My professional learning community (PLC) which was the math department collaborated to create effective and engaging lessons that helped students with a knowledge gap. I realized the significance of collaborating with colleagues to identify common problems and develop solutions that work as a team. </p>

     <p class="experience"> Would I have done any of those activities or taught differently now? Yes, most definitely! I learned about things that are not included in the job description such as building rapport with students and picking up on body language.
