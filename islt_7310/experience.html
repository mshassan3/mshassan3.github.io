    <p class = "experience">I taught sixth grade math at Bryant Middle School during my first-year teaching. I learned how to hold student accountable but in a way that maintains respect amongst them. I learned how to use the program to take attendance, learned the curriculum to teach the content, managed the classroom environment, graded assignments, gave feedback, and had class discussions. 
    </p>
    <p class="experience">For the last four years, I have taught seventh grade math (including an intervention and accelerated course). From this experience, I learned about PBIS (positive behavior interventions and supports) and the new curriculum of McGraw Hill as well as the new standards seventh grade math. I finished my credential and cleared my credential during this time as well. I successfully developed a Powtoons video during this time to teach algebraic expressions. I developed and grew from survival mode to how can I teach the most effectively, considering what a learning objective and backwards planning looks like. Additionally, I wanted to engage my students and I wanted to know how engaging technology can be. I found that after using multiple different programs, Nearpod has been the most interactive with students and it holds all students accountable as opposed to randomly calling on students to share. In addition to my duties teaching sixth grade, I analyzed my studentsâ€™ diagnostic scores to see where they were in math. When I had a majority that were low, I would review and reteach and if it was a select few, I would try to help them more one-on-one.
    </p>
    <p class="experience"> This upcoming school year, I am excited to teach eighth grade industrial arts (technology) and study skills. Thus far, I have learned how to create my own class website on Google Sites. I realized there is such a big difference in creating a site on Google Sites and using html and CSS to develop a site. While it is faster and much easier to develop a Google Site, there is not as much room for individuality and uniqueness like there is when developing a website with CSS and HTML. I am still learning more about the Paxton Patterson curriculum and I have not been able to use it in the classroom or have the hands-on training due to COVID-19. Everyone in education is learning how to navigate distance learning and teaching right now.  </p>
    
     <p class="experience"> Would I have done any of those activities or taught differently now? Yes, most definitely! I learned about things that are not included in the job description such as building rapport with students and picking up on body language.  
    </p>
    
    <p class="experience">
    As I reflect, what I would do differently in my first year of teaching would encompass what I have learned from my experience teaching the last four years. I would not say I regret the mistakes I made because I know I grew from them and they were all learning experiences. I am an ongoing learner and plan to continue to be.</p>
