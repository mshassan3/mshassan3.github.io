        <!--The following is a short paragraph about me including my welcome statement-->
        <p class="para">Hi! Welcome to my professional website!A website that consists of my professional background and professional development as an educator. My name is Mehnaz Hassan. My first experience observing from a teacher’s point of view was during my fieldwork at UC Merced where I learned how significant self-reflection is to grow. After graduating, I was a substitute teacher at Chico Unified School District where I learned about classroom management. I worked hard to attended Fresno Pacific University while also teaching full time and commuting to work. I taught sixth grade math at Bryant Middle School my first-year teaching. For the last four years, I have taught seventh grade math (including an intervention and accelerated course). Thankfully, I did not have to commute anymore. This upcoming school year, I am excited to teach seventh/eighth grade industrial arts teacher and a period of AVID.
