        <p> Hi! Welcome to my professional website, a website that consists of my professional background and professional development as an educator. My name is Mehnaz Hassan. I earned my Bachelor’s of Science in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis in engineering and minor in natural sciences education from University of California, Merced. I was a substitute teacher at Chico Unified School District.  I attended Fresno Pacific University for my preliminary single subject math and cleared my credential with the Teacher Induction Program (TIP). My first academic school year, I taught sixth grade math at Bryant Middle School, and seventh grade math (including an intervention and accelerated course) since then. Throughout my career, I have continued to be an ongoing learner by participating in professional development.
