 <h1>Project 2</h1>
    <h3>Nearpod</h3>
    
    
    <p class ="para2">In the last few years of teaching, I have learned making the lesson interactive and engaging makes it more enjoyable for the teacher as well as the students. I have learned about quite a few different programs in the process of searching for a platform that was user friendly as a teacher and engaging for students. I found that learning and using Nearpod has been a great resource. Nearpod developers are continuously updating their website with more features that can be added on to teacher presentations to make learning more engaging and interactive for students.</p>
    <p class="para2">When I was first learning how to use Nearpod, my professional learning community and I created the <a href="https://share.nearpod.com/oHvftUD3A1">"Dueling Discounts" Nearpod</a> lesson. Then, I challenged myself with creating one with as many different possible activites from nearpod as I could with my <a href="https://share.nearpod.com/vi3Bo9eKPY">"First Days of School" Nearpod</a> lesson. Recently, I have been using Nearpods that are already created and modifying them to meet the students' needs.</p>
