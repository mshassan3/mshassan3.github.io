<p id="reflection">
    I have five years of experience teaching middle school students in a variety of settings. I taught seventh-grade children at an inner-city public school since August 2016 until last school year. I taught sixth and seventh grade level math, in both suburban and urban school districts for one and four years, respectively. My teaching experience at socioeconomically disadvantaged schools provided me with additional awareness and consideration to the needs of the diverse academic, socioeconomic, cultural, disabled and ethnic backgrounds. I appreciated the CPM (College Preparatory Mathematics) curriculum because it included more hands-on activities for students where they were meant to figure out the “why” with each other and groups.  The learning was more in the students’ hands.  I wanted to grow and challenge myself which is why I decided to switch from teaching math to technology.</p>
        
<p id="reflection2">Next school year, I have many goals including organizing all the materials before the school year starts. Once it does start, I would like to implement classroom management to provide a safe and effective learning environment for my students. I will be receiving training for Paxton Patterson and AVID. I am looking forward to implementing it and being able to learn from it. I am excited and would love to facilitate students in identifying and pursuing their college and career goals using the Paxton Patterson curriculum and AVID. Moreover, I would go a step above teaching the curriculum and teach students strategies for reading comprehension. I know a majority of the incoming students will have a knowledge gap due to COVID-19 and with the specific demographic of students, it will be even more beneficial to teach reading comprehension since students will be working on modules that involve a significant amount of reading comprehension.  </p>
        
<p id="reflection3"> It is my goal to combine my range of experiences with my ability to be a compassionate, enthusiastic, intelligent instructor who will make a positive contribution to my school and the larger community. I have an overwhelming amount of goals for the next school year which all involve making a successful school year for the students and for myself as a teacher. After reflecting, I realized it is important for me to break down these goals to more attainable and smaller chunks to reach the larger goal. It is also significant to plan and have realistic expectations. Furthermore, I would like to use web design and development, not only to enhance the learning experience for my students but to also create webpages and possibly work with teams from other organizations during the summer to improve my skills as a web developer. </p>
     
<h3 class="reflectionheader2">My Teaching Philosophy</h3>    
<p id="reflection4">My passion for collaboration with parents, administrators, and colleagues (seventh and eighth grade teachers) and making every opportunity available for students to succeed is a part of my teaching philosophy. I would like to teach my students to be lifelong learners and teach them life skills and tools to be successful. I prefer student centered lessons where students are required to use critical thinking, writing, or problem solving.
